# Advent of Code

## What is AoC ?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. People use them as [interview prep](https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497), company training, [university](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home) [coursework](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html), [practice](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584) [problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), or to [challenge each other](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some [problem solving skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/) will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## What can I find on this repo ?

**My** solutions to the challenges I completed throughout the years. I am absolutely **not** claiming these are the *only* solutions as one of the most fun parts of programming is comming up with different ways to do the same thing.

## What language are the answers in ?

I try to use a different language each year. For example in 2023 I used C++ and python in 2024.

## Can I view your solutions in ... ?

As I use a different language each year, I can't guarantee the project structure stays the same or the project files will work on your specific editor but feel free to take a look at the code.
There is also a CMakeLists.txt file for the times I do it in C/C++ but the rest of the time I usually use the closest JetBrains IDE or VS Code (in 2024, as of writing, I'm currently using PyCharm)

## When do you post answers ?

Usually when I complete them. Might be on the same day, might be a few days later. If you ask because you are stuck on a puzzle, I highly encourage you to come up with your own solution. Try analysing the provided exemples and breaking the problem in smaller steps. I'm sure you can do it ^^
